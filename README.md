# CMSIS-MLEK Examples

This repository shows the usage of the [CMSIS-MLEK](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-mlek-arm/overview/) and [tensorflow-lite-micro](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/tensorflow-lite-micro-tensorflow/overview/) software packs.

It contains configured [CMSIS Reference Applications](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/ReferenceApplications/) that are stand-alone example projects. Each example is independently configured for directly running on the related hardware board. When using [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://www.keil.arm.com/) open directly the folder of the related project as otherwise the `.vscode` configuration files would conflict.

Configured Boards:

- [Alif Semiconductor Ensemble E7 AI/ML AppKit](./Alif) utilizing Ethos-U55 and dual core configurations.
