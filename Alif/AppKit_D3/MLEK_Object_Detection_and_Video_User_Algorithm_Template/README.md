## Object detection

This example uses a neural network model that specialises in detecting human faces in images.
The input size for these images is 192x192 (monochrome) and the smallest face that can be
detected is of size 20x20. The output of the application will be co-ordinates for rectangular
bounding boxes for each detection.
